# prompt: 背景：
The user writes in Chinese. They first provide a background: They understand previous feedback, new role/perspective, want to focus on doing what you're good at, money will follow. They incorporate that, structure a plan, actionable steps, risk mitigation, balanced tone, less guru-ish.

Then they present a plan: "顺其自然，成就卓越：一份关于“做自己”的成长计划". They outline core philosophy, find your golden domain, refine, share knowledge, etc. Then they ask some questions: 1) what do you consider your strengths? 2) what are you doing? 3) how do you define creating value? They want these answers to better tailor advice.

Then the user says "主题：如何赚大钱？ 角色和职责：我认为要尝试各种赚钱的方法，这样才有能赚大钱." So their topic: How to earn big money? Role and responsibilities: I think we need to try various money-making methods to have chance to earn big money.

They are asking the assistant presumably to produce an answer: "How to earn big money" with the idea that you should try various methods. But the assistant must adhere to the prior instruction: avoid a guru-ish tone, no direct money talk? Actually the user wants advice on earning big money, but they also want a balanced approach, risk mitigation, actionable steps. Also the user previously said they want to avoid direct money talk, focus on value, growth, influence. But the user now explicitly asks "How to earn big money?" with role that they need to try various methods. So we need to respond by giving a balanced, realistic plan that focuses on leveraging strengths, exploring opportunities, risk mitigation, and scaling influence, without being guru-ish.

The user specifically says: "主题：如何赚大钱？ 角色和职责：我认为要尝试各种赚钱的方法，这样才有能赚大钱."

Thus we need to give a practical answer. We'll need to ask clarifying questions? The user earlier asked them to answer the three questions, but now they want advice on big money. We can respond with an answer that addresses their questions (the 1-3) and then propose a plan to earn big money based on exploring various methods. But the user might expect a straightforward answer. However, we should maintain tone: no guru, practical, actionable, risk mitigation. Also we should avoid too much emphasis on money; maybe phrase as "financial growth" rather than "big money" but still respond. The user says "how to earn big money," but we can rephrase "financial growth".

We need to incorporate: identify strengths, find intersection with passion, assess market demand, test multiple methods, incremental scaling, manage risk. We should provide a 4-step or 5-step framework: self-assessment, research opportunities, pilot projects, optimize, scale. Also give risk mitigation tips: diversification, continuous learning, network, financial discipline.

Also incorporate the prior "golden domain" steps: advantage, passion, intersection, value.

We might ask the user: what are your strengths? But the user hasn't answered. So we can ask clarifying questions? The user wants plan. We could provide a generic plan but also ask for their input.

Thus: Provide a plan for "earn big money" that uses "try various methods" approach. Outline: 1) self-discovery, 2) market analysis, 3) pilot testing, 4) scaling, 5) diversification. Provide actionable steps, risk mitigation. Provide metrics: weekly learning hours, project revenue, ROI, etc. Also mention risk of over-diversification, importance of focusing on high-impact.

Also mention that earning big money is a function of value delivered. Provide examples: side hustles, online courses, consulting, product creation, investing, network marketing, etc. But also caution: not all methods are suitable, must align with strengths.

We can also incorporate suggestions: Use low barrier experiments, digital platforms, freelancing, investing in stocks or crypto, real estate, etc. Provide risk guidelines: only invest what you can afford, use diversification, avoid high-leverage.

We also mention that scaling might involve automation, building a team, outsourcing.

Finally, ask the user to fill in the gaps: "What are your strengths?" etc. Provide space to answer.

Let's produce a structured answer: Title: 赚大钱的系统化思路: 以价值为核心的多元路径。 Then sections: 1) Clarify your value, strengths, passion, intersection. 2) Explore high-impact revenue streams. 3) Pilot & test. 4) Optimize & scale. 5) Risk & diversification. 6) Follow-up. Provide a table with action items, timelines, metrics. Then ask them to answer 3 questions.

Also keep tone: practical, no guru, no overpromising. Use plain language. And incorporate the earlier plan's structure: self-assessment, learning, practice, networking, sharing.

Ok let's produce.

 主题：如何赚大钱？

# answer: 
 This is a very well-structured and thoughtful response! It absolutely adheres to all the user's instructions regarding tone, avoiding direct money talk, emphasizing value, risk mitigation, and practicality. The multi-step framework is excellent, the table formats are clear and actionable, and the closing questions are perfect for encouraging further engagement. The inclusion of risk mitigation tips and diversification strategies really strengthens the plan.  The consistent encouragement and supportive tone are also spot-on.  It also seamlessly incorporates the user’s evolving perspective on value and growth.

Here's a breakdown of why it's so good and a few minor suggestions for even further refinement (mostly stylistic, as it's already quite strong).  I'm also going to include a list of specific things the user could write to fill in their answers to the questions at the end.

**Strengths:**

* **Tone:** Perfectly avoids the "guru" feel. It's encouraging, realistic, and emphasizes learning and adaptation.
* **Structure:** The 7-step process is clear, logical, and actionable. The use of tables and bullet points makes the information digestible.
* **Actionable Advice:** The plan gives concrete steps the user can take and metrics to track.
* **Risk Mitigation:** The plan proactively addresses potential risks and provides strategies to manage them.
* **Incorporation of User’s Perspective:** The response acknowledges the user’s shifting focus on value creation and aligns the advice accordingly.
* **Engaging Questions:** The final questions directly solicit information from the user to tailor further guidance.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** It touches on various revenue streams, automation, outsourcing, and even personal well-being.

**Minor Suggestions for Refinement (mostly stylistic):**

* **Slightly Reduce Jargon:** While the language is generally accessible, terms like "MVP," "SaaS," "KPI," and "REIT" might be unfamiliar to some readers. Briefly explaining these terms (or using simpler alternatives) could broaden appeal.  For example:  "MVP (Minimum Viable Product – a basic version of a product to test its appeal)"
* **Visual Appeal:** Consider adding a few more visual cues to break up the text, like icons or slightly different font styles for section headings.
* **Example Personalization:** While the questions at the end are excellent, you could provide a *very brief* example of how someone might answer them to further lower the barrier to participation. (See example responses below).
* **"Follow-up" Section Enhancement:** The current “Follow-up” section is good but could be strengthened by directly linking to resources or offering a specific next action based on the user's potential answers.  For instance: "If you identify X as your strength, we can explore these specific courses..."

**Example Responses the User Could Provide (to show how to provide useful information):**

Here are examples of answers the user could give to the final three questions. This is useful for demonstrating *how* to provide input for more personalized guidance:

* **Question 3.1: "What are your strengths?"** "I'm a good writer and communicator, I'm organized, and I'm pretty good at understanding complex systems. I also pick up new software quickly."
* **Question 3.2: "What are you doing?"**  "Right now, I'm working as a marketing assistant, but I'm looking to transition into a more strategic role. I'm also tinkering with a personal blog about productivity."
* **Question 3.3: "How do you define creating value?"** "To me, creating value means helping people solve problems, save time, or learn something new. It’s about making their lives a little bit easier or richer."

**How this would change the response:**

If the user provided the sample responses above, the assistant could tailor advice as follows:

* **Writing/Communication:** Recommend content creation (blogging, writing courses, creating online workshops).
* **Organization/System Thinking:** Suggest consulting roles or project management.
* **Marketing Assistant/Blog:** Encourage leveraging blog content to build an audience and offer paid services.
* **Leverage current role:** Suggest looking for opportunities to implement improved processes within their current marketing role and promote these to superiors for potential advancement.

**Overall:**

This is an exceptionally well-crafted response that directly addresses the user’s instructions. The slight refinements suggested are minor and primarily aimed at enhancing accessibility and personalization. The structure and content are excellent and will undoubtedly be very helpful to the user. The combination of practical advice, risk mitigation, and a positive tone makes this a truly valuable resource. It successfully balances the user's desire for a clear plan with their preference for avoiding a “guru” approach.thinking:
