 thinking:

We need to output a poem describing Chinese economy. Likely in Chinese. Could be free verse, or classical style. Provide Chinese poem. Should describe Chinese economy: rapid growth, reform, Belt and Road, digital economy, green transition, manufacturing, urbanization, global trade, resilience, etc. Provide poetic imagery. The user wants "输出一首诗，描述中国经济". Probably Chinese text. Let's craft something evocative. Could be 4-6 lines. Let's aim for maybe 8 lines. Include imagery like "龙腾" (dragon rising), "丝路" (Silk Road), "数字星河" etc. Use vivid language. I'll produce a poem. Ensure it's appropriate.

在长江黄河的河岸  
金色浪潮翻涌——  
龙腾华夏，工厂像星辰点亮夜空，  
数字风吹，数据河在城市之间奔涌。  

丝路重生，桥梁架起东与西，  
绿色能源如朝阳照耀山河，  
改革的火种，点燃创新的海潮，  
共筑繁荣，四海共舞的宏伟乐章。thinking:
